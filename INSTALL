INSTALLATION
------------

Debian and RPM users can download freshly built binaries here:

    http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/

If you downloaded a tarball add /path/to/cola/bin to your $PATH.


REQUIREMENTS

Python 2.4 or newer
    http://python.org/
    apt-get install python

PyQt 4.3 or newer
    http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
    apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools


ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS (optional)

pyinotify (enables inotify support on Linux -- highly recommended)
    http://pyinotify.sourceforge.net/
    apt-get install python-pyinotify

simplejson (enables bookmarks)
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson
    apt-get install python-simplejson


BUILDING FROM SOURCE

Normally you can just do "make install" to install git-cola
in your $HOME directory ($HOME/bin, $HOME/lib, etc).
If you want to do a global install you can do

    # make prefix=/usr install

You can also run git-cola without installing it.
It is designed to run directly out of the source tree
This is the best way to run git-cola when you're
modifying the code.

    $ make
    $ bin/git-cola



PYUIC4 ISSUES

An older version of pyuic4 generated code that could not be
run by PyQt4.  This problem has been fixed in the latest
versions of PyQt4 (4.4.x), but you might encounter it if
you are not running the latest version of PyQt4.

If you try to run git-cola and see error messages
about "setSortingEnabled(..)" then your pyuic4/PyQt4
version is affected. There's a simple workaround, though:
remove the line of code listed in the traceback and
everything should work fine.

Update: setup.py currently works around this pyuic4 bug.
A bug report has been issued upstream.


PYUIC4 AND WINDOWS

To build cola on windows you'll need to copy the win32/pyuic4
shell script to a directory in your path.

    $ cp win32/pyuic4 /usr/bin

WINDOWS INSTALLATION

1) Install the native Python2.5 and PyQt4 installers (in that order):
    http://python.org/download/
    http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php

2) Install msysgit:
    http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/WindowsInstall

3) Install simplejson:
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson

4) Install dirname:
    http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/win32

    You can either download the provided Windows dirname binary
    or you can use the 'dirname' script from the win32/
    directory of the cola source tree.

    Copy either of these to /usr/bin or anywhere else in your $PATH.

5) Download and Install cola:
    http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/win32/

    $ cd /c/Python25/Lib/site-packages
    $ tar xvfz /path/to/cola-*-win32.tar.gz


6) Install the cola shell script and batch file:

    $ cp cola/bin/cola      /usr/bin
    $ cp cola/bin/cola.bat  $WINDIR/System32/cola.bat

    Both of these scripts are available in the win32/ directory
    of the cola source tree.  These are also available for download
    from http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/win32/

    You should now be able to launch cola by simply typing 'cola'
    from either a 'Git Bash' or 'cmd.exe' shell.


voila, cola on Windows.


NOTE: Windows is not the developer's primary platform.
Patches are greatly appreciated.  An installer would be awesome.
