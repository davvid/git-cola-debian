    # apt-get install git-core python python-qt4

Python 2.4 or newer

BREWING INSTRUCTIONS
    # apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools

Normally you can just do "make install" to install git-cola
in your $HOME directory ($HOME/bin, $HOME/lib, etc).
If you want to do a global install you can do

    # make prefix=/usr install

The "install" target will by default include copies of
simplejson and jsonpickle.  If your system already has these
modules installed then you can specify standalone=true when running "make":

    $ make prefix=/usr standalone=true install


You don't need to install cola to run it.
git-cola is designed to run directly out of its source tree.

    $ make
    $ bin/git-cola


MAC OS X INSTALLTION INSTRUCTIONS

Whether you install cola yourself with "make install" or
use the "git-cola.app" bundle, you will need to install
Qt and PyQt separately.

The easiest way to do this is to download the appropriate
installers for your platform.  If you have a platform
not listed here then we can use your help so that an
appropriate PyQt download can be made available.

For Intel Leopard machines that means installing:

    "Cocoa: Mac binary package for Mac OS X 10.5 - 10.6 (32-bit and 64-bit)"
    ~ http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/qt-for-open-source-cpp-development-on-mac-os-x/
    ~ http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-mac-opensource-4.7.1.dmg

and PyQt from the git-cola google code download page:

   "PyQt 4.8.2 for Intel Leopard"
    ~ http://code.google.com/p/git-cola/downloads/list


For Intel Snow Leopard machines download both the Qt and PyQt
snow leopard packages and install them:

    "Qt x.x.x for Intel Snow Leopard"
    ~ http://code.google.com/p/git-cola/downloads/list

    "PyQt x.x.x for Intel Snow Leopard"
    ~ http://code.google.com/p/git-cola/downloads/list

Once these have been installed then you can download either
git-cola.app or install from source using "make install".
Installing these packages also gives you a PyQt development
environment which can be used for building your own applications
or hacking on cola itself.

    # the only cola made with real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup

Download the latest stable Git, Python 2.6, and Py26-PyQt4 installers
    http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
    http://python.org/download/
    http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

Download the latest git-cola-[version].exe installer
    http://cola.tuxfamily.org/releases/win32/

Once it's installed you can run it from the Start menu or
from a Git Bash by typing 'cola'.

If you're developing cola on Windows you can run cola out of its source
tree by using the 'win32/cola' shell script.

    $ /c/Python26/python setup.py build
    $ win32/cola

Note: win32/cola assumes you've installed Python in /c/Python26 or /c/Python25.
Adjust accordingly.

You can also add python to your path and run bin/git-cola directly.
