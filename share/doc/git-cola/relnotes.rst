git-cola v1.4.1.2
=================

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* It is now possible to checkout from the index as well
  as from `HEAD`.  This corresponds to the
  `Removed Unstaged Changes` action in the `Repository Status` tool.
* The `remote` dialogs (fetch, push, pull) are now slightly
  larger by default.
* Bookmarks can be selected when `git-cola` is run outside of a Git repository.
* Added more user documentation.  We now include many links to
  external git resources.

Fixes
-----
* Fixed a missing ``import`` when showing `right-click` actions
  for unmerged files in the `Repository Status` tool.
* ``git update-index --refresh`` is no longer run everytime
  ``git cola version`` is run.
* Don't try to watch non-existant directories when using `inotify`.

Packaging
---------
* The ``Makefile`` will now conditionally include a ``config.mak``
  file located at the root of the project.  This allows for user
  customizations such as changes to the `prefix` variable
  to be stored in a file so that custom settings do not need to
  be specified every time on the command-line.
* The build scripts no longer require a ``.git`` directory to
  generate the ``builtin_version.py`` module.  The release tarballs
  now include a ``version`` file at the root of the project which
  is used in lieu of having the Git repository available.
  This allows for ``make clean && make`` to function outside of
  a Git repository.
* Added maintainer's ``make dist`` target to the ``Makefile``.
* The built-in `simplejson` and `jsonpickle` libraries can be
  excluded from ``make install`` by specifying the ``standalone=true``
  `make` variable.  For example, ``make standalone=true install``.
  This corresponds to the ``--standalone`` option to ``setup.py``.


git-cola v1.4.1.1
=================

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* We now use patience diff by default when it is available via
  `git diff --patience`.

* Allow closing the `cola classic` tool with `Ctrl+W`.

* Update desktop menu entry to read `Cola Git GUI`.

Fixes
-----
* Fixed an unbound variable error in the `push` dialog.

Packaging
---------
* Don't include `simplejson` in MANIFEST.in.
* Update desktop entry to read `Cola Git GUI`.


git-cola v1.4.1
===============

This feature release adds two new features directly from
`git-cola`'s github issues backlog.  On the developer
front, further work was done towards modularizing the code base.

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* Dragging and dropping patches invokes `git-am`

  http://github.com/davvid/git-cola/issues/closed#issue/3

* A dialog to allow opening or cloning a repository
  is presented when `git-cola` is launched outside of a git repository.

  http://github.com/davvid/git-cola/issues/closed/#issue/22

* Warn when `push` is used to create a new branch

  http://github.com/davvid/git-cola/issues/closed#issue/35

* Optimized startup time by removing several calls to `git`.


Portability
-----------
* `git-cola` is once again compatible with PyQt 4.3.x.

Developer
---------
* `cola.gitcmds` was added to factor out git command-line utilities
* `cola.gitcfg` was added for interacting with `git-config`
* `cola.models.browser` was added to factor out repobrowser data
* Added more tests

git-cola v1.4.0
===============

This release focuses on a redesign of the git-cola user interface,
a tags interface, and better integration of the `cola classic` tool.
A flexible interface based on configurable docks is used to manage the
various cola widgets.

Usability, bells and whistles
-----------------------------
* New GUI is flexible and user-configurable
* Individual widgets can be detached and rearranged arbitrarily
* Add an interface for creating tags

  SSH passwords on fetch/push/pull

  warns when lines get too long
* The `cola classic` tool displays upstream changes
* `git cola --classic` launches `cola classic` in standalone mode
* Provide more information in log messages

Fixes
-----
* Inherit the window manager's font settings
* Miscellaneous PyQt4 bug fixes and workarounds

Developer
---------
* Removed all usage of Qt Designer `.ui` files
* Simpler model/view architecture
* Selection is now shared across tools

  will refuse to push when run without specifying the remote name
  and branch.  See the `git` release notes for more information
* Support `open` and `clone` commands on Windows
