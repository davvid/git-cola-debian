1. Repository Status

   The repository status view displays paths that git detects as either
   staged for the next commit (`Staged`),
   modified relative to the staging area (`Modified`), or
   an unresolved file from a merge (`Unmerged`).

   A file can be staged or unstaged by either double-clicking on its name or
   single-clicking on its icon.  Right-clicking on an entry displays additional
   actions that can be performed such as launching `git-difftool` or `git-mergetool`.

2. Diff View

   The diff view displays diffs for selected files.
   Additions are shown in green and removals are displayed in light red.
   Extraneous whitespace is shown in a pure red background.

   Right-clicking in the diff view provides access to additional actions
   that can operate on the cursor location or selection.

3. Diff Hunks

   The `@@` diff headers divide each diff region.  Selecting specific lines
   and using the 'Stage/Unstage Selected' actions will operate on that
   subset of the diff.  Clicking within a diff region and selecting
   the 'Stage/Unstage Hunk' action will operate on the entire region
   within the diff header.
