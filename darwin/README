To build Mac OSX installers you need to setup your build environment
first.  MacPorts can be used for this.

The macports-setup-dev-env.sh script sets up your build environment.
It'll take a long time to run.

Once you've installed the macports packages then you should be able
to run cola out of its source tree.  This is a good sanity check
before trying to build git-cola.app:

	$ cola=$PWD
	$ make
	$ cd $there
	$ $cola/bin/git-cola

Once that's working then you can generate git-cola.app:

	$ make git-cola.app
	# double-click or run 'open' on the generated .app bundle


NOTE: Some Mac OS X flavors won't be able to run the generated git-cola.app
when macports is installed on the system.  There is a problem where
the dynamic loader tries to load the Qt libraries twice.

This workaround was not needed on an Intel Leopard machine but was
needed when testing the package on a PPC Tiger machine.  YMMV.

A workaround that allows you to test the .app is to fake the
removal of macports:

	cd /opt
	sudo mv local local.bak
	open /path/to/git-cola.app # this should work now
	sudo mv local.bak local

Don't try this unless you have problems running git-cola.app on a
mac build machine.  Some Mac OS X variants do not have this problem
and it's likely that the problem only exists on PPC Tiger machines.
