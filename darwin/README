To build Mac OSX installers you need to setup your build environment
first.  MacPorts can be used for this.

The macports-setup-dev-env.sh script sets up your build environment.
It'll take a long time to run.

Once it's complete, running this from the command-prompt
generates git-cola.app:

	$ make git-cola.app


If you're using macports then you'll have to add
/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.Framework/Versions/Current/bin
to your $PATH so that you can build and run cola from its source tree.

	$ cola=$PWD
	$ make
	$ cd $there
	$ $cola/bin/git-cola
