    logging: add support for the cola.showoutput configuration variable
    
    This makes it so that the log window honors cola.showoutput.
    
        never = never show output
        always = always show the output
        errors = only show output on errors (default)
    
    This was done by centralizing logging logic in qtutils.log() and adding
    a model.should_display_log(status) method.

    difftool: change trap condition from SIGINT to INT
    
    Markus Heidelberg provided this patch against git.git's
    contrib/difftool.
    
    In 'man 1p trap' there is written:
    
       "The condition can be EXIT, 0 (equivalent to EXIT), or a signal
        specified using a symbolic name, without the SIG prefix, [...]"
    
       "Implementations may permit names with the SIG prefix or ignore case
        in signal names as an extension."
    
    So now we do it the POSIX compliant way instead of using an extension.

    git: change with_extended_output to only return status, output
    
    The stderr+stdout handling in the git module was broken because it
    could deadlock on older versions of Python.  All of the complication
    came from trying to handle both stderr and stdout in the same
    function.  We now pass stderr=subprocess.STDOUT to subprocess.Popen
    so that things become much simpler.  We only include stderr when
    with_extended_output=True, otherwise we ignore it.
    
    This fixes deadlocks on older Pythons and on Mac OSX.
    It also seems to speed things up a bit on Linux, which is a plus.

    qobserver: fix a bug where we would respond to redundant notifications
    
    When setting a text field Qt triggers a callback.  We catch this callback
    and update our model accordingly.  When the model updates, it triggers
    another callback which causes a feedback loop that eventually resolves
    with the text field getting set twice.  This is problematic since
    it makes entering text problematic.
    
    We now detect this situation and stop the notification loop accordingly.

    Qt doesn't have a convenient dialog to allow both existing

    qtextedits unconditionally eat \r\n when returning the selection.

    If we're not able to find the selection in the diff then we know

    Guess the correct encoding for each diff line.
    
    Git can handle any type of file, whatever encoding it uses
    (or a broken one). Git-cola must not fail (or complain) when
    trying to show that data.
    
    Git-cola only handles utf8 in diffs, which is not very useful
    when your project has different encodings.
    
    This patch adds a very simple encoding guess for each line.
    Do not try to do this at the whole file, because it is useful
    when you are viewing a diff of a encode change.

    cola: completely rework the cola user interface
    
    git-cola now provides a repository status view that closely matches the
    output of 'git status'.
    
    The staged and unstaged lists were replaced by a single tree view.
    Likewise, rest of the UI was simplified to account for this --
    e.g. there are no more dock widgets in use.
    
    New icons were added for the Staged, Modified, and Unmerged categories.

    difftool launchers: better behavior when amending commits
    
    If you launch git-difftool from the right-click context menus it now takes
    the value of the New Commit / Amend Last Commit radio buttons into account

    The biggest difference is that a completely staged file launches with

    git-difftool: compare against the index by default for all commands
    
    This reworks git-difftool so that the command invocations are slightly
    closer to git-mergetool.  One big difference is that we show things from
    oldest to newest when there are changes in both the worktree and the index.
    
    In that case:
    	BASE=the latest commit
    	LOCAL=the index
    	REMOTE=the worktree
    
    Certain diff commands were adjusted so that they would show these three
    states in a left-to-right progression since that made most sense to
    english speakers.

    Change things so that we use diff, diff-index and ls-files to determine
    what's changed, staged, unmerged, and untracked.

    git-difftool: better behavior for unmerged files
    
    If a file is created in two branches then it won't exist in the index (yet)
    but will be valid for diffing.  git-difftool now handles this case.

    cola: improve unicode support
    
    These changes improve unicode support so that commit messages,
    etc. can be written in non-english languages.  These changes
    make it possible to commit Japanese (and other text) into a
    utf-8 project.  We may need to modify things so that we use
    the git project's default encoding in the future.

    branch compare: do not relaunch difftool when using double-click
    
    If we double-clicked on a file in the file list then we don't
    need to relaunch difftool when the 'Ok' button is clicked.
    Otherwise, the 'Ok' button launches difftool and closes the
    file list.

    The common case (no changes in the index) was creating a

    ui: redo the layout so that we have a central widget
    
    Previously, the main interface shunned having a central
    widget in favor of purely having dock widgets in the
    dock areas.  Since I haven't figured out how to make
    a splittable dock area be the central widget, I made
    the status widget the central widget and placed all of
    the other windows in the left dock area.
    
    TODO: figure out whether we can have a nice splittable,
    dockable layout.  It was possible in qt3, but it does seem
    like some of this functionality might not be accessible
    from python.

    git-cola now has a mergetool option in the
    right-click menu when running on non-macos,
    non-windows platforms.
    
    The reason for blocking out windows and macos
    is that there is no simple way to spawn a terminal
    for the interactive mergetool session.
    
    We could, of course, write our own mergetool wrapper
    in Python, but this is the easiest way for now.

    We were getting some backtraces when launching apps in the

    This reworks the implementation to avoid subprocess.
    
    The downside is that we now rely on shell_quote().
    I'm probably doing something wrong, or there's some weirdness
    introduced when running under PyQt.

    views: reworked item selection dialogs
    
    There are now two simple dialogs for quickly
    selecting items from a list.  One uses a qlistwidget
    and the other uses a combobox.

    cola: centralized tmpfile management
    
    git-cola now keeps temp files around until
    the application is shut down.
    
    This is more convenient since we no longer
    have to worry about unlinking files.

      models: update to the latest GitPython API (again)

commit cf3d0f3e7b63bd139b3c87862f0057156a014eb6
Author: David Aguilar <davvid@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 26 00:11:49 2008 -0700

    models: update to the latest GitPython API (again)
    
    GitPython removed get_git_dir() and get_work_tree().
    git.Git() now requires that a path is passed to it as well.
    
    All of cola's interaction with GitPython is now isolated
    to the GitCola class.  This commit adds these useful
    methods to the GitCola class.

    controllers: generalized the diff gui for 'Apply Diff From Branch'
    
    The diff gui can now apply diffs against arbitrary revisions.
    This makes it possible to use git cola to do things like diff

    Use the maxsplit argument to str.split when parsing config files.
    
    This is so you can use the "=" symbol inside .gitconfig without raising a
    ValueError.
    
    Git seems to parse lines in gitconfig like:
    	work-week = log --author=Kelvie --since=last.sunday
    without any issue, so this seems appropriate.

    model: improve the core model to allow recursive object structures
    
    Previously, the logic for serializing/deserializing to/from dictionaries
    did not properly deal with lists of hashes, hashes of lists, lists, etc.
    
    The core model can now handle any arbitrarily complicated structure.
    The core to_dict() routine recursively walks the object structure
    without the need for external data for tracking parameter types.

    git.py: use a dispatcher to allow for more dynamism
    
    The goal of these changes is to allow runtime creation
    of arbitrary git commands.  e.g. git.branch() should
    return the output of "git branch."  We do this by
    using a module dispatcher/__getattr__ to intersept
    attributes.  Eventually, the git.py module should
    be very tiny as the hand-coded methods are
    phased out.

    Added support for py2exe thanks to Sebastian Schuberth
    
    ugit.py was adjusted to account for __file__ not being available when
    using py2exe.  The py2exe setup scripts were provided by Sebastian for
    inclusion with the win32 release.  scripts/build-win32.sh was adjusted
    accordingly.

    Refactored the QObserver API
    
    Subclasses are no longer required to call model_to_view.  If the convention of naming
    view widgets the same as the model's parameters is followed, then a lazier
    add_observables call can be used.  This is now used consistently throughout ugit.

    Properly undo changes when cancelling out of the options gui using the ESC key
    
    Previously, hitting ESC to exit out of the options gui was not properly notifying
    the main app about needing to update/revert the fonts back to their original values.
    This fixes that problem and removes some code by specifying the connection between
    the optionsgui.cancel_button signal and the optionsgui.reject slot in the ui file.
    We then catch the reject signal in the controller and handle that.  The reason it
    didn't work previously is that we were only handling the case were cancel was pressed
    instead of explicitly handling the rejected() signal.

    We now change the disabling of model notification in when setting Qt widget params instead of when setting model params.  This undoes a previous fix that was added to the options controller that would refresh the historybrowser line in the options gui.  That code is no longer needed with this change.  An added benefit is that the interactive font updating is fixed/enabled with this fix.

    cmds: Fix spurios IOErrors by using QProcess to run commands
    
    Python's commands module sometimes raises IOErrors, which may be related to
    signal handlers set by Qt.  It is likely that Qt manipulates Unix signals,
    though I did not find a reference clearly stating this.  Certain signals,
    notably signals related to child process handling, may cause read calls to
    be interrupted.  Such an interruption seems to be transformed into an
    IOError by Python's commands module.
    
    The spurious errors are know to occure on Mac OS X with
        Python 2.3.5 (#1, Jan 13 2006, 20:13:11)
        [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5250)] on darwin
    
    Using QProcess as a replacement fixes the error.  Qt knows about its own
    signal handler manipulations.  The spurious errors are gone.

    QProcess to avoid spurious IOErrors.

        With the exception of GitController's cb_rescan, these were all
        removed.  cb_rescan needs it because it also responds to the
        untracked checkbox's stateChanged(int) signal which passes in
        the current state of the checkbox.

        Fixed a bug when changing directories
    
        When changing into a directory with fewer items than the current directory the cb_item_changed callback is triggered.  When it's triggered the listwidget's current property still points at the old value of "current," thus we have an array index that is out of range.  We now guard against overstepping the item_sha1s array.

        Added HTML escaping to the diff viewer.
    
        - Added scripts/html2py.pl for dumping Perl's HTML::Entities
          as a Python dictionary.
        - Added ugitutils.html_encode (ansi) for encoding
          HTML entities.
        - Updated ugitcmds and ugitcontroller to support the new
          diff output format.
        - Tabs are now displayed as eight HTML spaces (&nbsp;) in the
          diff display.  The diff display is HTML-based and since
          there is no HTML tab-equivalent this is the best compromise.
