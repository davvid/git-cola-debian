    If you launch git-difftool from the right-click context menus it now takes

    git-difftool: compare against the index by default for all commands
    
    This reworks git-difftool so that the command invocations are slightly
    closer to git-mergetool.  One big difference is that we show things from
    oldest to newest when there are changes in both the worktree and the index.
    
    In that case:
    	BASE=the latest commit
    	LOCAL=the index
    	REMOTE=the worktree
    
    Certain diff commands were adjusted so that they would show these three
    states in a left-to-right progression since that made most sense to
    english speakers.

    branch compare: handle double-clicks in the file list
    
    When comparing against another branch you can now double-click
    on the file list to launch a comparison against that file.
    
    This is nicer since you can now launch multiple comparisons at once.

    views: fix edge cases in selected_line()
    
    Selecting the first or last line was not getting properly handled.
    This fixes an off-by-one error for the offset and avoids using split
    when there is nothing to split.

    git-difftool: staged_files should not pass a commitish when using --ref
    
    The common case (no changes in the index) was creating a
    three-way merge when it should have done just two-way.
    This is because --cached doesn't make sense when comparing
    against a commitish.

    cola: add mergetool support
    
    git-cola now has a mergetool option in the
    right-click menu when running on non-macos,
    non-windows platforms.
    
    The reason for blocking out windows and macos
    is that there is no simple way to spawn a terminal
    for the interactive mergetool session.
    
    We could, of course, write our own mergetool wrapper
    in Python, but this is the easiest way for now.

    Something changed in PyQt where all of the localization
    strings had dialog-specific contexts in their names
    when passed to qApp.translate().  Since we're using
    simple .qm files (without any context) the fix is to
    simply blank out the context when calling translate.

    utils: rework fork()
    
    We were getting some backtraces when launching apps in the
    background with the subprocess-based fork() method.
    This reworks the implementation to avoid subprocess.
    
    The downside is that we now rely on shell_quote().
    I'm probably doing something wrong, or there's some weirdness
    introduced when running under PyQt.

    controllers: generalized the diff gui for 'Apply Diff From Branch'
    
    The diff gui can now apply diffs against arbitrary revisions.

    branches, remotes, etc.

    Use the maxsplit argument to str.split when parsing config files.
    
    This is so you can use the "=" symbol inside .gitconfig without raising a
    ValueError.
    
    Git seems to parse lines in gitconfig like:
    	work-week = log --author=Kelvie --since=last.sunday
    without any issue, so this seems appropriate.

    model: improve the core model to allow recursive object structures
    
    Previously, the logic for serializing/deserializing to/from dictionaries
    did not properly deal with lists of hashes, hashes of lists, lists, etc.
    
    The core model can now handle any arbitrarily complicated structure.
    The core to_dict() routine recursively walks the object structure
    without the need for external data for tracking parameter types.

    git.py: use a dispatcher to allow for more dynamism
    
    The goal of these changes is to allow runtime creation
    of arbitrary git commands.  e.g. git.branch() should
    return the output of "git branch."  We do this by
    using a module dispatcher/__getattr__ to intersept
    attributes.  Eventually, the git.py module should
    be very tiny as the hand-coded methods are
    phased out.

    Don't enable the diff gui when displaying the index
    
    The interactive diff gui menu actions were still enabled when displaying a diffstat or
    index.  The controller now tracks whether it's ok to enable patch selection,
    and disables it for diffstats/index views.

    Basically, a syntax-highlighted view of git diff --cached --unified=<n> --stat

    Add syntax highlighting for diffstats
    
    This patch teaches the DiffSyntaxHighlighter to highlight git diffstats.
    This was purely done by adding a new rule to the highlighter.
    The GenericSyntaxHighlighter was also fixed to allow empty matches.
    Some of the format variable names were changed to improve readability.

    Refactored QObserver class and removed lots of code
    
    Any invocation of add_callbacks or model_to_view will now automatically handle
    add_signals invocation for the widget of interest.  This removes almost every
    explicit call to add_signals.  autoconnect() methods were added to the QObserver
    to help facilitate this functionality.

    Properly undo changes when cancelling out of the options gui using the ESC key
    
    Previously, hitting ESC to exit out of the options gui was not properly notifying
    the main app about needing to update/revert the fonts back to their original values.
    This fixes that problem and removes some code by specifying the connection between
    the optionsgui.cancel_button signal and the optionsgui.reject slot in the ui file.
    We then catch the reject signal in the controller and handle that.  The reason it
    didn't work previously is that we were only handling the case were cancel was pressed
    instead of explicitly handling the rejected() signal.

    Change the qobserver's notification order.  This fixes a bug and removes code made unnecessary by this design.
    
    We now change the disabling of model notification in when setting Qt widget params instead of when setting model params.  This undoes a previous fix that was added to the options controller that would refresh the historybrowser line in the options gui.  That code is no longer needed with this change.  An added benefit is that the interactive font updating is fixed/enabled with this fix.

    cmds: Fix spurios IOErrors by using QProcess to run commands
    
    Python's commands module sometimes raises IOErrors, which may be related to
    signal handlers set by Qt.  It is likely that Qt manipulates Unix signals,
    though I did not find a reference clearly stating this.  Certain signals,
    notably signals related to child process handling, may cause read calls to
    be interrupted.  Such an interruption seems to be transformed into an
    IOError by Python's commands module.
    
    The spurious errors are know to occure on Mac OS X with
        Python 2.3.5 (#1, Jan 13 2006, 20:13:11)
        [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5250)] on darwin
    
    Using QProcess as a replacement fixes the error.  Qt knows about its own
    signal handler manipulations.  The spurious errors are gone.

    QProcess to avoid spurious IOErrors.

        Creating, deleting, moving or modifying files known to git now triggers
        inotify events.  ugit watches these events and rescans for changes
        automatically.

        Removed superfluous *args from most callbacks
    
        Callbacks that respond to parameter-less signals all had a superfluous *args argument that was never being used.
        With the exception of GitController's cb_rescan, these were all
        removed.  cb_rescan needs it because it also responds to the
        untracked checkbox's stateChanged(int) signal which passes in
        the current state of the checkbox.

        Fixed a bug when changing directories
    
        When changing into a directory with fewer items than the current directory the cb_item_changed callback is triggered.  When it's triggered the listwidget's current property still points at the old value of "current," thus we have an array index that is out of range.  We now guard against overstepping the item_sha1s array.

        Added HTML escaping to the diff viewer.
    
        - Added scripts/html2py.pl for dumping Perl's HTML::Entities
          as a Python dictionary.
        - Added ugitutils.html_encode (ansi) for encoding
          HTML entities.
        - Updated ugitcmds and ugitcontroller to support the new
          diff output format.
        - Tabs are now displayed as eight HTML spaces (&nbsp;) in the
          diff display.  The diff display is HTML-based and since
          there is no HTML tab-equivalent this is the best compromise.
