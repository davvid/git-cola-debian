    views.status: Eliminate X11 warnings
    
    Expanding childless top-level items causes X11 warnings to appear
    in the shell.  This was happening because we were looping over
    each top-level item inside of expand_items().
    
    expand_items() now expands the item passed into it only.

    cola.version: Fix builtin_version usage
    
    We no longer remote builtin_version in setup.py.
    This allows us to find builtin_version when running cola from
    its source tree.  We also break out of the loop when
    builtin_version is found which makes cola return the correct
    version number instead of always falling back to 'git describe'.

    models.main: Optimize stage_paths(), unstage_paths(), and revert_paths()
    
    We can do less in each function since nothing is observing the
    paths_staged/unstaged/reverted messages anymore.
    
    stage_paths() now benefits from only ever running at most 2 git commands
    to update the index - add for additions and add -u for removals.

    notification: Replace QObject usage with a pure-Python implementation
    
    Qt signals+slots are limiting because they don't allow optional
    keyword arguments.  Let's write our own so we can simplify the

    git: Make the git command class thread-safe
    
    This uses threading.Lock to serialize access to the git binary.
    Git calls fail when another git process is running due to the
    .git/index.lock file.  By serializing git calls we guard against
    threads triggering this condition.

    qobserver: Handle editable combo boxes in 'SLOT()'
    
    We used to avoid using Qt's data so that we'd always index into
    the model directly.  It's simpler to use it though, and also handles
    the editable combobox case.

    Detect upstream path changes on tracking branches
    
    In the classic view, when the current branch is tracking a remote
    branch, detect when there are changes to paths on the tracked branch.
    The 'Changed Upstream' status is lower priority than local changes
    (e.g., if a file is changed upstream, but is also locally modified,
    the classic view will show it as locally modified, but not changed
    upstream, since that is probably just confusing and there is limited
    space in the status area).
    
    A corresponding new action to 'checkout updated file' should be added
    to the list of actions for paths, and enabled when the path is
    'changed upstream'.

    refactor the cola package namespace
    
    The models, views and controllers packages were doing too much in module __init__.
    This simplifies things by doing nothing in __init__ and using the fully-qualified

    This adds a cola.models package that didn't exist before.

    difftool: change trap condition from SIGINT to INT
    
    Markus Heidelberg provided this patch against git.git's
    contrib/difftool.
    
    In 'man 1p trap' there is written:
    
       "The condition can be EXIT, 0 (equivalent to EXIT), or a signal
        specified using a symbolic name, without the SIG prefix, [...]"
    
       "Implementations may permit names with the SIG prefix or ignore case
        in signal names as an extension."
    
    So now we do it the POSIX compliant way instead of using an extension.

    git: change with_extended_output to only return status, output
    
    The stderr+stdout handling in the git module was broken because it
    could deadlock on older versions of Python.  All of the complication
    came from trying to handle both stderr and stdout in the same
    function.  We now pass stderr=subprocess.STDOUT to subprocess.Popen
    so that things become much simpler.  We only include stderr when
    with_extended_output=True, otherwise we ignore it.
    
    This fixes deadlocks on older Pythons and on Mac OSX.
    It also seems to speed things up a bit on Linux, which is a plus.

    The 'cola' wrapper script is now smarter in that it checks for

    qobserver: fix a bug where we would respond to redundant notifications
    
    When setting a text field Qt triggers a callback.  We catch this callback
    and update our model accordingly.  When the model updates, it triggers
    another callback which causes a feedback loop that eventually resolves
    with the text field getting set twice.  This is problematic since
    it makes entering text problematic.
    
    We now detect this situation and stop the notification loop accordingly.

    clone: assume that git url = the new destination directory
    
    Previously we used QFileDialog.getSaveFileName() and restricted
    users from selecting existing directories.
    
    We now use getExistingDirectory and assume that the destionation
    directory should just be the basename of the git url.
    
    We could prompt again, but that would be annoying.  Unfortunately
    Qt doesn't have a convenient dialog to allow both existing
    directories and new directory names (most of the world is centered
    around files, it seems, unlike git which is more dir tree-ish).

    qtextedits unconditionally eat \r\n when returning the selection.
    This breaks the interactive staging on files that contain \r\n.
    If we're not able to find the selection in the diff then we know
    that this has happened so simply replace \n with \r\n and try

    unicode: use core.encode() and core.decode() throughout git-cola
    
    This retrofits git-cola to use the new core encoding module.
    This centralizes all of the encoding duties so that we can modify them
    as needed.

    core: add a core module for holding core encoding routines, for now
    
    This creates generic core.encode() and core.decode() routines from the
    encoding-guessing patch provided by David Martínez Martí.

    Guess the correct encoding for each diff line.
    
    Git can handle any type of file, whatever encoding it uses
    (or a broken one). Git-cola must not fail (or complain) when
    trying to show that data.
    
    Git-cola only handles utf8 in diffs, which is not very useful
    when your project has different encodings.
    
    This patch adds a very simple encoding guess for each line.
    Do not try to do this at the whole file, because it is useful
    when you are viewing a diff of a encode change.

    This simplifies both the code creating the context menus and improves the

    to the top of each context menu permutation and adds separators to delineate
    less common/dangerous operations.

    controllers: disable single and double-click staging for unmerged items
    
    Accidentally staging an unmerged file loses the ability to launch
    git mergetool on the unmerged path.  This disables the convenient
    staging UI shortcuts for unmerged paths so that someone doesn't
    accidentally stage a file they are still merging.

    git-cola now provides a repository status view that closely matches the

    The staged and unstaged lists were replaced by a single tree view.
    Likewise, rest of the UI was simplified to account for this --
    e.g. there are no more dock widgets in use.
    
    New icons were added for the Staged, Modified, and Unmerged categories.

    startup: instead of bailing out, prompt for a git repo
    
    We used to previously bail out when we were launched from a non-git repo.
    This makes it so that we launch an open-directory dialog instead.

    difftool launchers: better behavior when amending commits
    
    If you launch git-difftool from the right-click context menus it now takes
    the value of the New Commit / Amend Last Commit radio buttons into account
    when creating the difftool command.
    
    The biggest difference is that a completely staged file launches with
    --commit=HEAD.  When amending, we launch difftool with --commit=HEAD^.

    git-difftool: compare against the index by default for all commands
    
    This reworks git-difftool so that the command invocations are slightly
    closer to git-mergetool.  One big difference is that we show things from
    oldest to newest when there are changes in both the worktree and the index.
    
    In that case:
    	BASE=the latest commit
    	LOCAL=the index
    	REMOTE=the worktree
    
    Certain diff commands were adjusted so that they would show these three
    states in a left-to-right progression since that made most sense to
    english speakers.

    style: use single quotes whenever possible
    
    We were mixing single and double quotes.
    Double quotes should only be used when the string itself
    contains single quotes.

    ui: redo the layout so that we have a central widget
    
    Previously, the main interface shunned having a central
    widget in favor of purely having dock widgets in the
    dock areas.  Since I haven't figured out how to make
    a splittable dock area be the central widget, I made
    the status widget the central widget and placed all of
    the other windows in the left dock area.
    
    TODO: figure out whether we can have a nice splittable,
    dockable layout.  It was possible in qt3, but it does seem
    like some of this functionality might not be accessible
    from python.

    The reason for blocking out windows and macos

    This reworks the implementation to avoid subprocess.

    models: update to the latest GitPython API (again)
    
    GitPython removed get_git_dir() and get_work_tree().
    git.Git() now requires that a path is passed to it as well.
    
    All of cola's interaction with GitPython is now isolated
    to the GitCola class.  This commit adds these useful
    methods to the GitCola class.

    Use the maxsplit argument to str.split when parsing config files.
    
    This is so you can use the "=" symbol inside .gitconfig without raising a
    ValueError.
    
    Git seems to parse lines in gitconfig like:
    	work-week = log --author=Kelvie --since=last.sunday
    without any issue, so this seems appropriate.

    model: improve the core model to allow recursive object structures
    
    Previously, the logic for serializing/deserializing to/from dictionaries
    did not properly deal with lists of hashes, hashes of lists, lists, etc.
    
    The core model can now handle any arbitrarily complicated structure.
    The core to_dict() routine recursively walks the object structure
    without the need for external data for tracking parameter types.

    git.py: use a dispatcher to allow for more dynamism
    
    The goal of these changes is to allow runtime creation
    of arbitrary git commands.  e.g. git.branch() should
    return the output of "git branch."  We do this by
    using a module dispatcher/__getattr__ to intersept
    attributes.  Eventually, the git.py module should
    be very tiny as the hand-coded methods are
    phased out.

    We now restore the active selection when rescans occur.  Previously we would
    lose the selection list and the scrollbar positioning.  All of these are now preserved.

    Properly undo changes when cancelling out of the options gui using the ESC key
    
    Previously, hitting ESC to exit out of the options gui was not properly notifying
    the main app about needing to update/revert the fonts back to their original values.
    This fixes that problem and removes some code by specifying the connection between
    the optionsgui.cancel_button signal and the optionsgui.reject slot in the ui file.
    We then catch the reject signal in the controller and handle that.  The reason it
    didn't work previously is that we were only handling the case were cancel was pressed
    instead of explicitly handling the rejected() signal.

    This commit enforces that ugit will only ever commit what is already staged (and thus in the stagedList).  Partial commits are not allowed, since that prevents partial commits.

    Simplified actions by sending along widgets of interest
    
    When a model's parameters change, and the system knows about a corresponding view widget, the mediator's action callback will now receive a reference to the view's widget when the action is called.  This simplifies a common pattern in the action methods.

    cmds: Fix spurios IOErrors by using QProcess to run commands
    
    Python's commands module sometimes raises IOErrors, which may be related to
    signal handlers set by Qt.  It is likely that Qt manipulates Unix signals,
    though I did not find a reference clearly stating this.  Certain signals,
    notably signals related to child process handling, may cause read calls to
    be interrupted.  Such an interruption seems to be transformed into an
    IOError by Python's commands module.
    
    The spurious errors are know to occure on Mac OS X with
        Python 2.3.5 (#1, Jan 13 2006, 20:13:11)
        [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 5250)] on darwin
    
    Using QProcess as a replacement fixes the error.  Qt knows about its own
    signal handler manipulations.  The spurious errors are gone.

    cmds: Refactor commands.getoutput to run_cmd()
    
    Direct calls to commands.getoutput() are wrapped in the function
    run_cmd().
    
    This is in preparation for replacing commands.getoutput with
    QProcess to avoid spurious IOErrors.

        Fixed a bug when changing directories
    
        When changing into a directory with fewer items than the current directory the cb_item_changed callback is triggered.  When it's triggered the listwidget's current property still points at the old value of "current," thus we have an array index that is out of range.  We now guard against overstepping the item_sha1s array.

          HTML entities.
        - Updated ugitcmds and ugitcontroller to support the new
          diff output format.
        - Tabs are now displayed as eight HTML spaces (&nbsp;) in the
          diff display.  The diff display is HTML-based and since
          there is no HTML tab-equivalent this is the best compromise.
