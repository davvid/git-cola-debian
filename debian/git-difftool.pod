=head1 NAME

git-difftool - stage changes using the standard git merge tools

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<git difftool> [--tool=<tool>] [--ref=<ref>] [--no-prompt] [<file>]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<git-difftool> is a git command that allows you to compare and edit files against arbitrary revisions using the standard git merge tools.

=head1 OPTIONS

-t or --tool=<tool>

    Use the merge resolution program specified by <tool>. Valid merge tools are: kdiff3, tkdiff, meld, xxdiff, emerge, vimdiff, gvimdiff, ecmerge, and opendiff

    If a merge resolution program is not specified, B<git-difftool> will use the configuration variable merge.tool. If the configuration variable merge.tool is not set, git-difftool will pick a suitable default.

    You can explicitly provide a full path to the tool by setting the configuration variable mergetool.<tool>.path. For example, you can configure the absolute path to kdiff3 by setting mergetool.kdiff3.path. Otherwise, B<git-difftool> assumes the tool is available in PATH.

    Instead of running one of the known merge tool programs B<git-difftool> can be customized to run an alternative program by specifying the command line to invoke in a configuration variable mergetool.<tool>.cmd.

    When B<git-difftool> is invoked with this tool (either through the -t or --tool option or the merge.tool configuration variable) the configured command line will be invoked with with the following variables available: B<BASE> is the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file from the index. B<LOCAL> is the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file as it appears in the work tree; B<REMOTE> is the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file from the reference being merged; B<MERGED> contains the name of the file to which the merge tool should write the results of a successful merge. set to the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the index; $LOCAL set to the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file as it appears in the work tree; $REMOTE set to the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file to be merged, and $MERGED set to the name of the file to which the merge tool should write the result of the merge resolution.

    If the custom merge tool correctly indicates the success of a merge resolution with its exit code then the configuration variable mergetool.<tool>.trustExitCode can be set to true. Otherwise, B<git-difftool> will prompt the user to indicate the success of the resolution after the custom tool has exited.

-r or --ref=<ref>
    Specifies a commit-ish reference to compare against. B<git-difftool> compares against the index by default.

--no-prompt
    Do not prompt before and after launching a merge tool.

=head1 CONFIG VARIABLES

merge.tool
    The default merge tool to use.

    See the --tool=<tool> option above for more details.

mergetool.<tool>.path
    Override the path for the given tool. This is useful in case your tool is not in the PATH.

mergetool.<tool>.cmd
    Specify the command to invoke the specified merge tool.

    See the --tool=<tool> option above for more details.

mergetool.<tool>.trustExitCode
    For a custom merge command, specify whether the exit code of the merge command can be used to determine whether the merge was successful. If this is not set to true then the merge target file timestamp is checked and the merge assumed to have been successful if the file has been updated, otherwise the user is prompted to indicate the success of the merge.

mergetool.keepBackup
    After performing a merge, the original file with conflict markers can be saved as a file with a .orig extension. If this variable is set to false then this file is not preserved. Defaults to true (i.e. keep the backup files).
